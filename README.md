The Ars Electronica Futurelab is an artistic R&amp;D laboratory and atelier. Together with worldwide partners, we aim to humanize technologies and inspire the public. We therefore create tangible future prototypes and experiences: interactive installations, immersive artworks, technical solution approaches, workshops, experiments, and more.
